<p>This is a Java library which makes PKCS#11 (also known as Cryptoki) 
modules accessible from within Java. 
A PKCS#11 module is a software library. It
usually comes with hardware security modules (HSM), smart cards
and crypto tokens (e.g. USB tokens). Thus, the PKCS#11 Wrapper
provides Java software access to almost any crypto hardware. For
example, a Java application can use it to integrate a HSM or a
smart card to create digital signatures, to decrypt data or to
unwrap keys.</p>
<p>This library does <b>not</b> contain a provider implementation
for the Java Cryptographic Architecture (JCA) framework. However,
there is a different product which provides this &mdash; the <a
href="http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core-Crypto-Toolkits/PKCS_11_Provider">IAIK
PKCS#11 Provider</a>.</p>
<p>The PKCS#11 Wrapper consists of a Java part consisting of Java
classes and a native part which is a shared library. The native
part is written in ANSI-C. It is precompiled for Windows,
Linux, Solaris 8/9/10 and Mac OS X </p>
<p>The <a href="Introduction.pdf">introduction document</a> gives a
brief introduction into the architecture of the library.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="ProgrammerManual.pdf">programmer's manual</a>
giving a quick introduction for software developers. More details 
about the API and its use is in the 
<a href="api/index.html">JavaDoc</a> of the API.</p>
<p>The <a href="FAQs.htm">FAQs</a> provide answers to
frequently asked questions and provide solutions for common
problems.</p>
<p>The <code>src/java</code> directory contains the Java part of the
library and the <code>examples</code> directory contains some demo
programs. Please note that some of the samples use the 
<a href="http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Products/Core-Crypto-Toolkits/JCA_JCE">IAIK-JCE</a>
library which is <b>not</b> part of the IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper.
There is also a sample applet in <code>applet-demo</code>
 which shows the usage of the wrapper in an applet.
The <code>src/native</code> directory contains the native
part of the library; i.e. the C source code of the shared library
<code>pkcs11wrapper</code>. In the <a href=
"Changes.html">changes</a> file, there is a list of all changes
between the different versions of the wrapper. The best of all,
we provide the IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper under the terms of an Apache style
license. This means, it can be used for free even in commercial
environments.
