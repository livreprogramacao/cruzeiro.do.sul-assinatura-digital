    <P><b>This product allows easy integration of smart cards, USB tokens and HSMs
    into Java&trade; applications. It provides a simple 
    <code>java.security.KeyStore</code> view of
    these tokens and makes cryptographic operations of these devices accessible
    via the JCA/JCE framework. For the application, it is just like working 
    with pure software crypto and file key stores. The library accesses the 
    hardware tokens via the PKCS#11 API, also known as Cryptoki. Hence, it can
    work with any product which supports PKCS#11.</b></P>
    
    <P>This package contains a provider implementation of the Java&trade; Cryptography 
    Extension (JCE, specified by SUN). It is based on the IAIK PKCS#11 Wrapper 
    and the IAIK-JCE. Thus, it supports Windows, Linux, MacOS and Solaris platform out 
    of the box. Support for other platforms can be added easily, because the 
    code of the underlying PKCS#11 Wrapper is available under an Apache-style 
    license and can be ported with little effort. It runs on JDK 1.3 or later.</P>

    <P>The IAIK JCE Provider for PKCS#11 provides cryptographic functionality, 
    including hash functions, message authentication codes, symmetric, 
    asymmetric, stream encryption, block encryption, key and certificate 
    management. It makes most of the functionality of the PKCS#11 standard 
    accessible to Java&trade; applications through the JCE API from SUN. This enables 
    developers to use cryptographic hardware within their Java&trade; applications. 
    Applications which are already based on a pure software implementation of 
    the JCE API can use cryptographic hardware with little or no change of their 
    existing applications. </P>
    
    <P>All cryptographic tokens compliant to PKCS#11 version 2.20 or lower can 
    be used; this includes cryptographic smart cards and USB tokens as well as 
    hardware security modules (HSMs). 
    In particular, we tested with products from A.E.T., SUN, Utimaco, 
    SafeNet, Mozilla, etc.</P>
