These demos show the basic usage of the IAIK PKCS#11 provider.
A few of these demos use the IAIK elliptic curve library to handle elliptic curve keys. 
To run these demos, you must include the iaik_eccelerate file. This JAR file is part 
of the IAIK-ECCelerate library. You may get a evaluation version from the IAIK web site
http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Download.
