These demos show how to use the IAIK PKCS#11 provider in combination with  
XSECT to create and verify XML signatures. Configure your PKCS#11 module by
editing the resources/iaik/pkcs/pkcs11/provider/IAIKPkcs11.properties file.

If not already present, you must include the XSECT library file (iaik_xsect.jar) in the lib directory. You can download an evaluation 
version from our website http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/sic/Download. 
In addition, you have to include all libraries required by XSECT (e.g. 
xercesImpl.jar, xalan.jar, xmlParserAPIs.jar).
