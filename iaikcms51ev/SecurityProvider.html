<p>&nbsp;IAIK-CMS adopts the SecurityProvider model introduced by the IAIK SSL/TLS 
  library (<i><a href="http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/products/02_isasilk/index.php" target="_blank">iSaSiLk)</a> 
  </i>for centralizing all cryptographic tasks into one class, <a href="docs/iaik/cms/SecurityProvider.html" target="_blank">iaik.cms.SecurityProvider</a>. 
  The SecurityProvider model used here is similar to that of <i>iSaSiLk</i> except 
  for a the following changes: 
<ul>
  <li>Because of the high dependence of CMS onto ASN.1, <i>IAIK-CMS</i> makes 
    use of the ASN.1 library of the crypto toolkit <i><a href="http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/products/01_jce/index.php" target="_blank">IAIK-JCE</a></i>; 
    so it cannot be used without having IAIK-JCE in the classpath (which does 
    not necessarily mean to have to use (all the) the cryptographic engines provided 
    by IAIK-JCE; i.e. any cryptographic task may be performed by any proper cryptography 
    provider supporting the required engine). 
  <li>Since CMS certificate handling requires access to certificate properties 
    not supported by the JCA certificate API, any X.509 public key certficate 
    used for IAIK-CMS has to be supplied as <code>iaik.x509.X509Certficate</code>, 
    and any attribute certificate has to be supplied as <code>iaik.x509.attr.AttributeCertificate</code>.
     
    An application wishing to use certificates from other providers may use methods 
    <code>convertCertificateChain</code>   and <code>convertToAttributeCertificateChain</code> 
     
    of the IAIK-JCE crypto toolkit for converting them into the IAIK X.509 representation 
    before using them with IAIK-CMS. Please note that both, <code>iaik.x509.X509Certificate</code> 
     
    and <code>iaik.x509.attr.AttributeCertificate</code>   fit into the JCA certificate 
    API because being descendants of class  <code>java.security.cert.Certificate</code>.
     
    Unfortunately <code>java.security.cert.Certificate</code>   only groups public 
    key certificates; so <code>iaik.x509.attr.AttributeCertificate</code> 
     returns 
    <code>null</code>   when calling method <code>getPublicKey</code>. 
  <li>Most of the <code>getEngine</code> 
     methods of the SecurityProvider class do
    not specify the requested engine by its name; rather the engines are
    requested by its AlgorithmIDs as used with CMS
  <li>Wheras <i>iSaSiLk</i> consults the SecurityProvider for getting the required 
    -- if necessary -- initialized engine and subsequently performs the cryptographic 
    operation on the engine itself, IAIK-CMS -- where appropriate -- allows the 
    SecurityProvider to do the whole cryptographic task. This shall give a SecurityProvider 
    implementing application more independence in how to perform the cryptographic 
    operation. When, for instance, allowing the SecurityProvider to calcualte 
    a RSA signature value, the specific SecurityProvider implementation itself 
    may decide to use a Cipher or Signature engine or any other way to get the 
    Signature value (e.g. from a Smartcard). This concept provides more flexibility, 
    but sometimes may require some knowledge about the way the CMS protocol expects 
    a cryptographic operation has to be performed. However, in general you may not have to 
    take care about the IAIK-CMS SecurityProvider at all because you simply can
    use the default SecurityProvider.
  </li>
</ul>

Class <a href="docs/iaik/cms/SecurityProvider.html" target="_blank"><code>iaik.cms.SecurityProvider</code></a> 
is the main class of the IAIK-CMS SecurityProvider model. It itself provides 
default implementations of all cryptographic operations required by CMS, expect 
for Ephemeral Static Diffie Hellman. Unfortunately there is no general way to 
initialize a KeyPairGenerator with algorithm parameters as required when creating 
a originator ESDH key pair with domain parameters matching to those of the public key
of the recipient. Thus the default implementation of method <code>generateKeyAgreementKeyPair(AlgorithmID 
keyAgreeAlgorithm, PublicKey otherKey)</code>   has to throw an exception and has 
to be implemented if using another cryptographic provider than IAIK. The same 
applies to method <code>createSharedKeyEncryptionKey</code>   which cannot handle 
an ESDHKeyAgreement in provider independent way. Thus it might 
be preferable to override all ESDH related methods when intending to use another 
provider than IAIK. 
<p>With class <a href="docs/iaik/cms/IaikProvider.html"><code>IaikProvider</code></a> 
  
  IAIK-CMS contains an SecurityProvider implemention for the IAIK cryptography 
  provider of the crypto toolkit IAIK-JCE. Please note the difference: The IAIK 
  provider is a JCA/JCE cryptography provider supplying cryptographic engines; 
  Class <code>IaikProvider</code> is an IAIK-CMS SecurityProvider implementation that makes 
  the cryptographic engines of the IAIK JCA/JCE cyrptography provider available 
  for IAIK-CMS. 
<p>Per default IAIK-CMS is configured to look if the IAIK cryptography provider 
  is available. If yes, it uses the IaikProvider as SecurityProvider. If not it 
  uses the default SecurityProvider implementation. Thus if you want to use the 
  IAIK provider you do not have to take any care about the SecurityProvider setting. 
  However, if you do not want to use the IAIK provider for some reasons (e.g. 
  you require a specific, e.g. smartcard depending, handling for some tasks) you 
  have two options: 
<ol>
  <li>Use the default SecurityProvider implementation by setting it as SecurityProvider 
    to be used: 
    <pre>     SecurityProvider.setSecurityProvider(new SecurityProvider());
     </pre>
  <li>Implement your own SecurityProvider for the required cryptographic tasks 
    and install it as SecurityProvider to be used: 
    <pre>     MySecurityProvider mySecurityProvider = ...;
     SecurityProvider.setSecurityProvider(mySecurityProvider);
     </pre>
  </li>
</ol>

If choosing the second option from above basically you may follow one of two
ways for implementing your own SecurityProvider:
<ol>
  <li>You want to mainly use the IAIK JCE as a cryptography provider and use
    another provider just for a few algorithms. For example, you want to use a
    smartcard requiring a particular handling for RSA signature calculatuion.
  <li>You do not want to use the IAIK JCE at all and use only some other
    provider.</li>
</ol>

In the first case you may extend the IaikProvider class, e.g.: 
<pre> public class MySecurityProvider extends IaikProvider {


   ...
   

   public byte[] calculateSignatureFromSignedAttributes(AlgorithmID signatureAlgorithm, 
                                                        AlgorithmID digestAlgorithm, 
                                                        PrivateKey privateKey, 
                                                        byte[] signedAttributes) 

     throws NoSuchAlgorithmException, InvalidKeyException, SignatureException {
     

     byte[] signatureValue = null;
     // get the implementation name: RSA? (note that CMS indicates rsaEncryption as Signature algorithm)
     String implementationName = signatureAlgorithm.getImplementationName();
     if (implementationName == IMPLEMENTATION_NAME_RSA) {
       // let the smartcard calculate the signature value
       byte[] signatureValue = ...;

     } else {
       signatureValue = super.calculateSignatureFromSignedAttributes(signatureAlgorithm, 
                                                                     digestAlgorithm, 
                                                                     privateKey, 
                                                                     signedAttributes);
     } 
     return signatureValue;
   } 
 }
 </pre>

In the second case, if you want to use a different provider alltogether and not 
use the IAIK-JCE at all (for whatever reason ;-) you may start with the SecurityProvider 
class and override those methods where you cannot use the default implementation. 
<p>

Note that you also may install a SecurityProvider per CMS object. To, for instance,
use one specific SecurityProvider only for one specific <code>SignedDataStream</code>
 
object, you may use its  <code>setSecurityProvider</code>   method, e.g.:
<pre>
   MySecurityProvider myProvider = ...;
   SignedDataStream signedData = ...;
   signedData.setSecurityProvider(myProvider);
</pre>

Now <i>myProvider</i> will be used for any cryptographic operation required by 
this one specific SignedDataStream object. If any of the CMS objects (SignerInfos) 
belonging to this SignedDataStream object needs a SecurityProvider, it will use 
<i>myProvider</i>, too; except for those, who already have installed their own 
SecurityProvider. However, SecurityProviders are only forwarded from "higher" 
to "lower" objects, e.g.: if a SignedData(Stream) object has its own SecurityProvider 
it forwards it to its SignerInfos objects (as long as they do not already have 
their own SecurityProviders), but if a SignerInfo with its own SecurityProvider 
is added to a SignedData(Stream) object that has no SecurityProvider installed, 
the SecurityProvider of the SignerInfo is not forwarded to the SignedData(Stream) 
object. In this case the SignedDataStream object will use the default, system-wide 
installed SecurityProvider (which should be available in any case). <br>
If you want to use a specific SecurityProvider for a specific CMS object please look at the Javadoc if you
may add it by using method <code>setSecurityProvider</code>   (if present), or if you already
may install it via the constructor (which may required when, for instance, parsing a CMS object
that needs cryptographic engines already during the parsing procedure (e.g. for digest calculation
initialization when parsing a SignedData object)).
