/**
 * Demonstrates the usage of class {@link iaik.cms.AuthenticatedDataStream} and
 * {@link iaik.cms.AuthenticatedData} for recipient-specific protecting the 
 * integrity of a message using the CMS type AuthenticatedData with the
 * <code>HMACwithAESwrap</code> algorithm for wrapping the HMAC key.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <b>Attention:</b> This demo uses Static-Static Diffie-Hellman as key management 
 * technique for providing origin authentication. The mac key is wrapped by
 * using the HMACwith3DESwrap algorithm as specified by RFC 3537. Since this 
 * algorithm is not implemented by IAIK-JCE versions prior 3.181, this demo
 * at least may require IAIK-JCE 3.181 as cryptographic service provider.
 * <p>
 * This demo requires that you have <code>iaik_esdh.jar</code>
 * (or <code>iaik_jce_full.jar</code>) in your classpath.
 * You can download iaik_esdh.jar from <a href="http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/download/">
 * http://jce.iaik.tugraz.at/download/</a>.
