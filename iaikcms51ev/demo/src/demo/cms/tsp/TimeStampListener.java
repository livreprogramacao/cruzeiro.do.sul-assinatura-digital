/**
 * A simple SignedDataStream encode listener implementation allowing an
 * application to add a SignatureTimeStampToken attribute to the SignerInfo
 * of a SignedDataStream (during the encoding is performed).
 * <p>
 * Using an SignedDataStream encode listener for adding a SignatureTimeStampToken may
 * be useful when having to time stamp the signature calculated from a large data
 * volume. Since reading all the data into memory may cause an OutOfMemory problem, 
 * class {@link iaik.cms.SignedDataStream SignedDataStream} should to be used for
 * creating/encoding the SignedData object and the SignatureTimeStampToken may be 
 * added by means of a {@link iaik.cms.SDSEncodeListener SDSEncodeListener}.
 * <p>
 * This SDSEncodeListener implements method {@link #afterComputeSignature(SignedDataStream)
 * afterComputeSignature} to add a SignatureTimeStampToken attribute to the SignerInfo of a
 * SignedDataStream object (<i>Attention</i>: This demo assumes that the SignedData contains
 * only one single SignerInfo). When {@link #TimeStampListener(String) creating} a TimeStampListener
 * the HTTP URL of the Time Stamp Authority from which to get the TimeStamp has to be
 * supplied (<i>Attention</i>: This demo only works for TSAs that can be accessed via http).
 * This SDSEncodeListener implements method {@link #afterComputeSignature afterComputeSignature}
 * to connect to the specified TSA service to get a timestamp for the signature value
 * of the single SignerInfo object. The TimeStampToken received from the TSA then is
 * included as unsigned {@link iaik.smime.attributes.SignatureTimeStampToken SignatureTimeStampToken}
 * attribute into the SignerInfo object. If there occurs an error during the TSP processing
 * an exception is thrown, except the application has decided to {@link #setStopOnTSPProcessingError
 * finsih} the SignedData creating/encoding procedure without including the SignatureTimeStampToken
 * attribute (which then may be added later).
 * <p>
 * This SDSEncodeListener implementation is part of the CMS TimeStamp demo.
 * Please look at {@link demo.cms.tsp.TimeStampDemo TimeStampDemo} for an usage example:
 * <pre>
 * // cretae a SignedDataStream object
 * SignedDataStream signedData = ...;
 * ...
 * // add certificates and SignerInfo...
 * ...
 * // create and add a TimeStampListener to include a TimeStampToken to be obtained from the specified TSA
 * String tsaUrl = "http://...";
 * TimeStampListener tsl = new TimeStampListener(tsaUrl);
 * // debug info goes to System.out
 * tsl.setDebugStream(System.out);
 * signedData.setSDSEncodeListener(tsl);   
 * ...
 * // encode the SignedData to some output stream
 * OutputStream os = ...;
 * signedData.writeTo(...);
 * </pre>
